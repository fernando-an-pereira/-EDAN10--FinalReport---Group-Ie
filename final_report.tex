\section{Topic}
This paper discusses the introduction of SCM in a company (specifically the \emph{PonteVecchio Software}).

The project can be considered quite relevant due to the increasing productivity of the corporation which it may gain by using a SCM tool.

The main stakeholder of this project is the company management because their projects will be finished faster and as a result more products can be sold. This will also result in giving the company a chance to grow further without being interupted by the issues they are having today.

The developers and testers of the company are identified as secondary stakeholders because they should agree with the changes in the company and are directly effected by these changes. As some of the issues the developers and testers are having are caused by the lack of configuration managment and adding support will reduce the stress level for the developers and testers and will increase the moral of the team, making it a more pleasant work environment.

Other secondary stakeholders are costumers of this company. While not a direct stakeholder we have to consider, that their interests are effected by the work done in this project as it will increase the productivity of the company. Thus costumers will get a higher value back on their money and receive higher quality and lower delivery times.

\section{Problem statement}
A company (called \emph{PonteVecchio Software} or PVS for short) is a small software development company that has grown from 2 to 15 developers in the last 10 years. They have never introduced any form of configuration managment (CM for short) and are starting to notice that they have problems they can not quiet explain. They have heard that CM could help them with some of these problems and have requested a plan to introduce CM to the company in steps that will not disturbe their production but at the same time solve their issues.

Currently the company works on their source code using a single network resource to and from which everyone reads and writes. This is likely to be the cause of one of the issues they have been having which is that code that has been done seems to disappear from time to time without a trace. This is commonly known as the \emph{simultaneous update} problem in CM and is normaly solved using suitable software tools.

The simultaneous update problem that has been creeping into development has meant that the company has been forced to introduce a \emph{Waterfall method} of development that allows them dictate who can edit what files and when in order to minimize the problem. This in some ways might slow down production as delays in a single part of the plan set forward can cause chain reactions that delay the whole project.

Another issue that they have because of the shared network resource is that they do not have the ability to maintain old releases that have been delivered to costumers. While a copy of what was delivered to the costumer is kept on a CD which was created at release. While this copy does exist it does not provide any benefit to the company other then the ability to make a copy of it and deliver it to clients again if it is lost.

There is also an issue with that the company has no clear process for handling change requests which has resulted in some confusion among the employees. Mostly this happens when some interface or class changes how it is intended to be used or methods change name without the information that it will be changed or even has changed reaches all the developers.

While some of these issues could be easily fixed the company managment has also decided that they want to use exclusivly free tools to do so. While not a major problem it is one extra consideration to take into account when solving the issues the company has presently.

\section{CM Plan}

\section{SCM Tools}

To introduce the SCM in the company, a SCM tool is needed.
The most important aspect in choosing a SCM tool is that the developer team must accept it.
Therefore, instead of impose only one solution to the company it's preferable to introduce multiple likely choices and let the team opt which is the best.

\subsection{The tools}

There're lots of SCM tools available in the market. However, \emph{PVS} requires that it shall be free.
Another aspect, as the developers have little or no experience with SCM, it has to be easy to use.
Between all the options, two very popular ones will be introduced to the company: \emph{SVN} and \emph{Git}.
The developers will try between the two options and choose the best for them.

\subsubsection{SVN}

\subsubsection{Git}

\subsection{Evaluation method}

The tools will be tried by one week each. 
In the first day of the five days workweek, a brief course introducing the respective tool.
This course doesn't intend to be deep, just the basic use of the software will be teached, i.e., a short explanation of how it works and the commands needed to do simple tasks (\emph{diff}, \emph{commit}, \emph{update}, \emph{merge}).
It will last three hours.
During rest of the day and the other four days of the week, the team will use the tool in a real project.
